    "\n",
    "#### Method A: Submitting Directly from the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard method for code competitions. It ensures that your submission is linked to the code that produced it, which is crucial for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Save Your Work:** Click the **\"Save Version\"** button in the top-right corner of the notebook editor.\n",
    "2.  **Run the Notebook:** In the pop-up window, select **\"Save & Run All (Commit)\"** and then click the **\"Save\"** button. This will run your entire notebook from top to bottom and save the output, including your `submission.csv` file.\n",
    "3.  **Go to the Viewer:** Once the save process is complete, navigate to the notebook viewer page. \n",
    "4.  **Submit to Competition:** In the viewer, find the **\"Submit to Competition\"** section. This is usually located in the header of the output section or in the vertical \"...\" menu on the right side of the page. Clicking the **Submit** button this will submit your generated `submission.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "After submitting, you will see your score in the **\"Submit to Competition\"** section or in the [Public Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fds-pokemon-battles-prediction-2025/leaderboard?).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method B: Manual Upload\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also generate your predictions and submission file using any environment you prefer (this notebook, Google Colab, or your local machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Generate the `submission.csv` file** using your model.\n",
    "2.  **Download the file** to your computer.\n",
    "3.  **Navigate to the [Leaderboard Page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fds-pokemon-battles-prediction-2025/leaderboard?)** and click on the **\"Submit Predictions\"** button.\n",
    "4.  **Upload Your File:** Drag and drop or select your `submission.csv` file to upload it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is quick, but keep in mind that for the final evaluation, you might be required to provide the code that generated your submission.\n",
